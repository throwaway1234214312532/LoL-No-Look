# NoLooksies
Closes leagueclient when a Solo/Duo ranked game ends, so you can't see your lp gains or losses.

Perfect for those of us who let the LP get to our head and just want to focus on improvement!

Based on the no look challenge invented by Timmifer :tm:

Windows Only!!
## Install:
Download the NoLooksies.exe file from the latest release!
https://github.com/WoedWoef/NoLooksies/releases/tag/v2.0.0

Extract and place the file somewhere on ur pc.
You can now start the NoLooksies.exe file!

## Usage:

When you start the app it becomes a tray icon so you can see it in the bottom right in your task bar.
The app will now check for the ending of a solo duo ranked game, if it finds one, it will shut down the client so that you cannot see the lp change, and you have to make a conscious decision to play another!
The app will keep running and looking for new ranked games even when the client closes.


## Options:

Toggle program - Starts and stops the programs functionality, defaults to ON
 

Start on windows startup = <On/Off> - click to toggle the application to start automatically when your pc starts, defaults to OFF

 
Quit - Quits program


## Windows pop-up:
If you get a windows smartscreen pop-up with:
 
> *Windows protected your PC:*
 
> *Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.*


You can press *More Info* and then *Run Anyway* to start the program regardless.

### Reason for pop-up:
This popup is given because my application is not signed by a CA and therefore not recognized as an often used app by Windows.
Fixing this would require buying a cerficate which would cost a lot of money that I don't have.

It is signed and timestamped by me though:
